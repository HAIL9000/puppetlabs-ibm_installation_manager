## Overview

Manages the installation of
[IBM Installation Manager](http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/rational/ibm_installation_manager?productContext=-57272472)

## Module Description

This module will install the IBM Installation Manager.  Optionally, it can
deploy the installation from a source such as HTTP or a local file path.

## Setup

### What ibm_installation_manager affects

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter,
  impact, or execute on the system it's installed on.
* This is a great place to stick any warnings.
* Can be in list or paragraph form.

### Beginning with ibm_installation_manager

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps
for upgrading, you may wish to include an additional section here: Upgrading
(For an example, see http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/firewall).

## Usage

Example usage for installing Installation Manager from a source archive from
an HTTP repository:

```puppet
class { 'ibm_installation_manager':
  source => 'http://internal.lan/packages/IM.zip',
}
```

Example usage for installing Installation Manager from an existing path on
the filesystem.  As in, an already extracted archive from IBM:

```puppet
class { 'ibm_installation_manager':
  deploy_source => false,
  source_dir    => '/path/to/installation/IM'
}
```

Example usage for installing to a custom location:

```puppet
class { 'ibm_installation_manager':
  source   => 'http://internal.lan/packages/IM.zip',
  base_dir => '/opt/myorg/IBM',
  options  => '-acceptLicense -s -installationDirectory /opt/myorg/IBM',
}
```

If you're masochistic enough to use this software and feel up for it, I'd
greatly appreciate contributions.
